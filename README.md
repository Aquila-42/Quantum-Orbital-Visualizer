# Quantum-Orbital-Visualizer
An interactive Quantum Atomic Orbital visualizer built to explore wave function probability distributions ($s, p, d, f$ states). It uses MediaPipe for gesture-based "Quantum Scaling" and Three.js for rendering 15,000 particles with kinetic smoothing. A project born from a passion for making abstract physics tangible through AI.
